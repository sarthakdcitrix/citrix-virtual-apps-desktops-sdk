## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| State | Sets the state of configuration logging. Values can be:  
o Enabled - state changes will be logged. If logging is unavailable, the state change will still be permitted. o Disabled - state changes will not be logged.  
o Mandatory - state change will be logged. If logging is unavailable, the state change will not be permitted.  
When the state is set to Enabled or Mandatory, XenDesktop services will attempt to log operations (which perform configuration changes) before performing them. | false | false |  |
| Locale | Sets the language that logs should be recorded in. Values can be: 'en', 'ja', 'zh-CN', 'de', 'es' or 'fr'. | false | false |  |
| LoggingDBPurgeDurationDays | Sets the number of days for which the configuration logging logs will be retained. Any config logging data older than number of days set in this property will be purged. | false | false |  |
| PassThru | Returns the affected record. By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output. | false | false | False |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user. | false | false |  |
| TraceParent | Specifies the trace parent assigned for internal diagnostic tracing use | false | false |  |
| TraceState | Specifies the trace state assigned for internal diagnostic tracing use | false | false |  |
| VirtualSiteId | Specifies the virtual site id the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
